#### I'm a UK based web developer, currently working with MERN stack technologies and an inquisitive mind.
#### HyperionDev bootcamp grad currently on the hunt for that first position.

🔭 I’m currently building my Photo Mooch project. A full stack web app linked to @photo_mooch on Instagram. A creative prompt, art therapy app. MongoDB, Express.js, React build. Throwing in Redux, Mongoose, JWT, node..... to get it all working.

🌱 I’m currently learning deeper React / Redux features. Also still figuring out my workflow using copilot (my shouty mouthed pair-programmer.......) 

📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-ivkovic-68822474/)

💬 Ask me about breathing (trust me, it's more complex than you know). Also cycling, see you on Zwift!

🐕 Papa to a rascally whippet. 

Today I learnt that deleting old repos that were created for bootcamp tasks removes those commits from my graph...... it's not so green now :(
